### Welcome to @popsware Github

- Programming Idols: [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws), [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell).
- I like to try new things every now and then, so you will find  different projects here, using different technologies and languages.
- My main commercial projects are kept private, Unfortunately. Here and on my Bitbucket account.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning new techs, but i'll always prefer languages and technologies that i can learn while actually accomplishing some task with them.
